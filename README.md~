# blog_finder

This is a program written in Python that searches out the best blog posts on a given topic. The program searches [stackexchange](http://stackexchange.com) and [reddit](http://reddit.com) communities to find relevant blog post references, and sorts them by their relevance to the search term and number of upvotes. The result is a curated list of the best blog posts on a given topic.

This plot shows the similarity between two communities, [/r/datascience](reddit.com/r/datascience) and [/r/machinelearning](reddit.com/r/machinelearning). Both communities are likely to contain links to the same blog posts.

Correlation matrix of selected communities from the reddit and stackexchange communities, as measured by taking the log of the communitie's mutual cosine similarity. Most of the communities are focused on tech and programming, but two cooking communities [/r/food](reddit.com/r/food) and [/r/cooking](reddit.com/r/cooking) were included to illustrate a case with little correlation. Light colors indicate high correlation; the two communities with the greatest similarity are /r/datascience and stackexchange.datascience.

Scatterplot of post score vs cosine similarity for blog links in four communities. The search term was 'neural network'; points in the lower left represent blog posts having a combination of low post score and relevance to the search query.
